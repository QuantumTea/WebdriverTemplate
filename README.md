WebdriverTemplate
=================

Java template project for using Webdriver to test web apps. Uses JUnit, Selenium, and Mockito, also wraps some Apache Commons methods.

Drag and drop is something that needs fiddling with, I've never got it to work under Firefox. `hoverOverWebElement` works fine, as do `getWebElementSingle` and `getWebElementList`.

Property injection for `defaultSleep` on the ExampleTest doesn't work.
